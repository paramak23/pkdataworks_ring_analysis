Cheminformatics Ring Analysis with RDKit
This repository contains the code for my Medium article: "From Bench to Bytes: A Chemist’s Guide to RDKit & Python."

How to use:
Open the .ipynb file.

Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top.

Run the cells to analyze SMILES strings and classify ring systems.
